 README for rocketDrone
 Written on Mac OS using Eclipse Oxygen for Java SE JDK 8 - imported into CS50 IDE Cloud 9
 	- updates to this file using different OS or JDK might result in having to adjust some code
 	- note that this program will not run on cs50 IDE - cloud 9 does not support Java GUI - I learned this after the fact
 
 Next Steps in the Future
 	- make the drone less laggy and run more smoothly on the GUI
 	- make the walls not random - make them easy at first and get harder as levels progress
 	- add enemies!
 	- add power-ups!
 	- add animation to drone - the little fire triangle at its base right now is mediocre at best
 	
Extra Notes
	- I did test this on a windows OS - the GUI ran a little funky - not sure why, would need to look into it in future renditions
	- the game has its own instructions built into GUI but there is also a youtube video associated with it per the CS50 instructions for the project
	- A thanks to Harvard x EdX for the course!
